A Wayland compositor that takes the desktop metaphor quite literally.

WORK IN PROGRESS.

This project is still new, and will not be useful.

To do list:
 - make configuration much nicer and remove all the strcmps
 - fix issue where Shift-using key bindings require pre-shifted key in config
 - pan desk when focussing window in direction that isn't in view
 - xwayland
 - pinch gestures for desk zooming
 - draw rect with mouse when zoomed out to set new view
